## Installation

1. Create a folder to hold your installation: `mkdir expressCart`
2. FTP/Copy the contents of the zip to your newly created folder
3. Enter folder: `cd expressCart`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start application: `npm start --production`
6. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1111](http://127.0.0.1:1111) in your browser

Keeping expressCart running after closing the terminal can be done in a few ways but we recommend using the `PM2` package. To set this up:

1. Install PM2: `npm install pm2 -g`
2. Add expressCart to PM2: `NODE_ENV=production pm2 start app.js --name expressCart`
3. Check PM2 has our app: `pm2 list`
4. Save the PM2 config: `pm2 save`
5. To start/stop: `pm2 start expressCart` / `pm2 stop expressCart`

> Note: Node.js version 7.x or greater is needed.

### Docker

The easiest way to get up and running is using Docker. Once the Docker CLI is installed from [https://www.docker.com/get-docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).

1. Enter the root of the expressCart application
2. Change `/config/settings.json` - `"databaseConnectionString": "mongodb://mongodb:27017/expresscart"`
3. Run: `docker-compose up --build`
4. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1111](http://127.0.0.1:1111) in your browser
5. Optional. To install test data run the following 
- `docker exec -it expresscart bash`
- `npm run testdata`
- `exit`

### Deploy on Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/mrvautin/expressCart)

> Note: When deploying to Heroku you will need to configure your external MongoDB either on your own server or a hosted service on mLab, AWS etc.

### Sample/Test data

Sometimes you might want some default sample/test data. To create this, run `npm run testdata`.  
Warning: Remember to only run this initially or anytime you want to reset the data as this function deletes ALL existing data.

## API

There is currently a limited API for certain functions of the app. Using the API can be done by firstly generating an API key via the Admin login. `Admin > My Account > API Key (Generate) button`. Once an API Key is generated it will need to be supplied in a header called `apiKey` to authenticate requests. 

## Hooks / Integrations

On the completion of a order if a `orderHook` URL is configured, expressCart will POST the data to the configured URL. This is handy or IFTTT or Zapier Webhooks where you may want to use the integration methods to retrieve the order details in other systems.

Example use might be to send all orders to a Google Docs spreadsheet or an accounting package or a packing slip software etc.

## Admin

Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:1111/admin](http://127.0.0.1:1111/admin)

A new user form will be shown where a user can be created.

### Styling

Adding your own custom style is done by accessing the `Admin` panel then selecting `General settings`.

##### CSS

You can add your own custom CSS into the `Custom CSS` box. This will be minified and added to each page.

##### Footer

You can add your own custom HTML footer which may have contact details, social media links etc into the `Footer HTML` box. This will be added to bottom of each page.

### Products

Adding of new products is done via `/admin/product/new`.

##### Product price

Set this value to a full 2 decimal value with no commas or currency symbols.

##### Permalink

A permalink is a nice link to your product which is normally shown in search engine rankings. By default, a no Permalink value is set when adding a product one will be generated using the Product title with spaces replaced by dashes.

##### Variants

You may want to set product variants such as `Size`, `Color` etc.

Below is an explanation of the fields and what they do:

`Title` = Shown in the variants dropdown
`Price` = This will be shown to the customer when the variant is selected
`Stock` = An optional field to track stock of the variant. Overrides the default stock value for the product.

##### Product tag words

Tags are used when indexing the products for search. It's advised to set tags (keywords) so that customers can easily find the products they are searching for.

## Subscriptions (Stripe only)

You are able to setup product subscriptions through Stripe. First setup the `Plan` in the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) then enter the Plan ID (Formatted: plan_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX) when creating or editing a product. When purchasing, a customer can only add a single subscription to their cart at one time. Subscriptions cannot be combined with other products in their cart. On Checkout/Payment the customer and subscription is created in Stripe and the billing cycle commences based on the plan setup.

##### Subscription Webhooks (Stripe only)
You are able to configure a Webhook in Stripe to receive subscription updates on successful/failed payments [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks). The `expressCart` Webhook endpoint should be set to: `https://<example.com>/stripe/subscription_update`. You will need to set the `Events to send` value to both: `invoice.payment_failed` and `invoice.payment_succeeded`.

## Database

`expressCart` uses a MongoDB for storing all the data. Setting of the database connection string is done through the `/config/settings.json` file. There are two properties relating to the database connection:

Example MongoDB configuration:

```
{
    "databaseConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017/expresscart"
}
```

Note: The `databaseConnectionString` property requires a full connection string. You may need to add authentication parameters to your connection string.

>  For a good and reasonably priced MongoDB Host, we recommend [mLab](https://mlab.com).

## Configuration

Settings can be managed from the admin panel ([http://127.0.0.1:1111/admin](http://127.0.0.1:1111/admin)) with the exception of the Payment gateway and database settings.

All settings are stored in json files in the `/config` directory. The main application-level settings are stored in `/config/settings.json` while payment gateway settings are stored in files in the `/config` directory named after the payment gateway. For example, configuration for the Stripe payment gateway is stored in `/config/payment/config/stripe.json`.

Configs are validated against the schema files. For the `settings.json` this will be validated against the `settingsSchema.json` file. The Payment gateway config is validated agaist the `/config/payment/schema/<gateway>.json` file.

##### Local configuration

If you'd rather store settings in a file which isn't checked into version control, you can create a new settings file at `/config/settings-local.json` and store your complete settings there. When viewing or editing settings in the admin panel, expressCart will detect the existence of this file and update it accordingly.

##### Environment configuration

An alternative to local configuration is using an `env.yaml` file (in the root of app) to override settings. You may want to do something like:

``` yaml
development:
  port: 1111
  databaseConnectionString: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/expresscart
production:
  port: 2222
  databaseConnectionString: mongodb://prod_db_url:27017/expresscart
```

The app will read in the `NODE_ENV` and switch and override any valid settings. Eg: `databaseConnectionString` set in the `env.yaml` file will override anything in `settings.json` file (including local).

This can also be used for payment modules too. Any settings in the `env.yaml` file will override the `/config/payment/config/<gateway>.json` file.

##### Cart name and Cart description

These values are used for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes. They will be used as the title and description when your website is listed in Google and other search engines.

The `Cart name` is also used if there is no logo set.

##### Cart image/logo

Generally you would place your logo into the `/uploads` folder. You would then add the value `/uploads/mylogo.png` to the `Cart image/logo` setting value.

##### Cart URL

This value is vital for your cart to work. Set this value to your domain name/URL which customers will access your website. This value is used in returning from Paypal
payments and the sitemap for search engine indexing.

##### Cart Email

This email is used for any email receipts which are sent by your website.

##### Payment Gateway

This determines which payment gateway to use. You will also need to configure your payment gateway configuration file here: `/config/payment/config/<gateway_name>.json` or use the `env.yaml` file.

##### Currency symbol

Set this value to your chosen currency symbol. Eg: $, £, €.

##### Themes

Themes are a set of handlebars views and a stylesheet file. See `Cloth` theme as example.

Themes are loaded from `/views/themes/`.

It would be great to have some themes contributed back for others to use.

##### Number of Products per page

You can set the number of products per page by changing the `Products per page` value to a whole number of your choice. You may want to ensure
the number of products per page matches up with the `Products per row` value. Eg: if you have the `Products per row` value set to 3, you may want
to ensure the `Products per page` is a multiple of 3 for the best look.

##### Number of Products per row

This is the number of products displayed per row on your website. You can select anywhere up to 4 `Products per row`.

##### Menu enabled

Enables/disable the menu setup in `/admin/settings/menu`.

##### Menu header

This is the text which will be displayed at the top of your menu.

## Modules
It's possible to extend the basic functionality of `expressCart` using modules. All modules are loaded from `/lib/modules` at startup and added to the `config` for use throughout the app. There is an example module `shipping-basic` to calculate the flat shipping rate. One way to extend this basic module is to call a Postage service like [easypost](https://www.easypost.com/) to get an accurate rate for your location, package size etc.

## Email settings

You will need to configure your SMTP details for expressCart to send email receipts to your customers.

You will need to consult your email provider for the relevant details.

##### Gmail settings

- `Email SMTP Host` = smtp.gmail.com
- `Email SMTP Port` = 465
- `Email SMTP secure` = True/Checked
- `Email SMTP Username` = example@gmail.com
- `Email SMTP Password` = yourpassword (you may need to setup an application specific password for this to work)

##### Zoho settings

- `Email SMTP Host` = smtp.zoho.com
- `Email SMTP Port` = 465
- `Email SMTP secure` = True/Checked
- `Email SMTP Username` = example@zoho.com
- `Email SMTP Password` = yourpassword

##### Outlook settings

- `Email SMTP Host` = smtp-mail.outlook.com
- `Email SMTP Port` = 587
- `Email SMTP secure` = False/Unchecked
- `Email SMTP Username` = example@outlook.com
- `Email SMTP Password` = yourpassword

You can use the `Send test email` button to ensure your email settings are correct.

## Menu

Although `expressCart` is a search based shopping cart, you can also group your products into categories using tags. You can then setup menu Items to "filter" based on
keywords (tags) to make it easier for your customers.

Setting of menu items is done via `/admin/settings/menu`.

To add a new menu item to filter products, you will set the menu text using the `Menu` field and setting the keyword to filter is using the `link` field.

To add a new menu item to link to a static page, you will set the menu text using the `Menu` field and set the static page URL using the `link` field. Eg:
An `About` page would be set. Menu = 'About Us', Link = 'about`

You can re-order menu items by clicking and dragging the arrows icon and placing the menu item in desired position.

## Static pages

You may want to create a static page to show contact details, about us, shipping information etc.

New static pages are setup via `/admin/settings/pages`.

## TODO

- Modernize the frontend of the admin

## Contributing

I'm looking for contributors of any kind. I'm working on turning the admin panel into something more modern and using Vue.js. The frontend part of the website will always be a normal webapp with no SPA frameworks as I believe eCommerce apps should have SEO as top priority.

Contributing payment providers and themes would be much appreciated. Payment providers are added by simply adding the payment provider file to `/lib/payments/provider.js`.

If you see current code which could be enhanced (note: parts of the code is quite old but new to Github) you are welcome to submit a PR.
